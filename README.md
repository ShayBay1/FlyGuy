FLYGUY! a variation of HangMan.

For my project I wanted to do an inverted version of HangMan. I wanted the user story to be a positive spin on the classic game that we all played as kids.

The user story in this game is made up of just a few key points.
- the user guesses a letter, leading to one of two things:
- Either the guess is correct and the guessed letter is displayed in its place on the screen, and a random selection from an array of possitive affirmations is displayed.
- Or the guess is wrong and the lives left count is displayed along with a comment from the hate mongers below FLYGUY.
-In the case that no more letters remain to be guessed. the app Alerts that the user has one the game and directs the user to press the play again button.
-In the case that the number of lives falls below 1, the Alert is displayed stating that the game is over.

In the link below you're able to play the game. Give it a try, its easy!

Just guess the letters and, if you win, fly away!

Down the road I'd like to incorperate a filter of some sort that will discolor and distort the page in the case that the game is lost.

Id also like to make the img of the zombies move up at each guess instea od just displaying the lives left.

Below is the link to the public GitHub Repo that includes my HTML, CSS, and JS files.
